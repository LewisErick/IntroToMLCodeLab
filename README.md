# IntroToMLCodeLab
A codelab with all you need to be prepared with (datasets) for the class on Thursday.

Be sure to clone this repository before class on Thursday:

```
git clone https://github.com/LewisErick/IntroToMLCodeLab.git
```

I highly reccommend that you first complete the Pre Codelab before digging in on this one:

Just run all the cells in the Jupyter Notebook (Kernel -> Restart & Run All) and you're good to go! :)

If you have any problems or doubts be sure to raise an issue on this repos!
